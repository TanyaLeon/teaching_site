I've been backpacking again and in breaks between walks and eating ('cause that's basically what you do when backpacking, right?) I was reading. About hiking, and backpacking, and climbing etc. Naturally. What a coincidence. =)

I like this one 'cause it's actually very nicely structured and quite a page-turner too. You see, it consists of short articles on a certain topic varying from miscellaneous kinds of outdoor activities to philosophical epiphanies. I like those. It's like sharing something very personal with your reader and it's much appreciated not only by me (or so it seems 'cause why else that guy would have so many grateful readers). You can check for yourself if you go to his site www.semi-rad.com
or get a book of his most read articles which I happened to come across.
