        <p class="letter">o guys, the thing is we're practising teachers of English coming from a non-English-speaking country, but speaking the official language here as little as possible. Why? That's because we're practising English teachers, all right. And good ones too. With diplomas, certificates and everything. But the best part is we still haven't lost hope in our students and craft. So brace yourselves 'cause this knowledge is coming your way. <br> <br>
            P.S. Hope to be of some help and inspiration to some of you.
